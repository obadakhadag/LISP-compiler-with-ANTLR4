This project is a LISP compiler built in Java using ANTLR4.

Defines LISP grammar (Compiler.g4, CompilerParser.g4)

Generates lexer and parser code (gen/)

Builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) with visitor/listener patterns

Provides sample input (input.lisp) and a driver (Main.java)

Supports parsing, analyzing, and interpreting LISP expressions

Useful for learning compiler construction, parsing with ANTLR4, and working with abstract syntax trees in Java
